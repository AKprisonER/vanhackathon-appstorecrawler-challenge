### Vanhackathon 2017

### Challenge Description
The best performance indicator of a mobile application is the category ranking and overall ranking inside an app store. The main stores are Google Play and Apple App Store, and there are several sub categories inside those stores such as social networking, shopping, games etc.

Your challenge is to crawl the app stores to get 1. Overall Ranking (If exists) and 2. Category Ranking of a mobile app for the selected Country, once the user enters their app name or their store link of the app.

For example I have an Android mobile app named " My Talking Tom". There will be a basic user interface where I will enter my app name and get today's United States rankings as: Games Free = 36, Overall = 92.

Bonus: Get also app details: icon, screenshots, description.
